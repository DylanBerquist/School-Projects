		<p style="color: #009B95;">My name is Dylan Berquist. I am originally from Pinckney, Michigan. I graduated from 
		Pinckney Community Highschool in 2017. I graduated with a small group of students participating
		in the "New Tech" alternative to normal high school. New Tech is a completely separate set of classes
		oriented around project-based learning. I found the majority of my best friends through this program, 
		considering the small size of the program, we were basically forced to get to know and work with one another.</p>
		<p style="color: #009B95;">I only have one sibling, my older sister Tina. 
		I have a pretty big family, considering all of the separating and rebuilding my 
		entire family has gone through. All of the major holidays are total chaos for my sister and I.
		There are usually around 3-4 celebrations for each of the major holidays. Which means a lot of gifts I have to
		buy for everyone, which also means draining my entire paycheck every time.</p>

			<li>The hobby that I currently have the most fun with is playing the bass guitar. 
			I started playing the bass in October of 2017. I haven't been completely dedicated to it since
			I started, so I wouldn't really consider myself to be "good" at it by any means. But it is something I
			do have a lot of fun with. Back when I first started I played in a band composed of some of my best friends, 
			but that didn't go anywhere.</li>
			<li>Another hobby of mine lately has been playing Dungeons & Dragons. I play with a group small group of close friends every week. 
			We meet every Sunday at 7pm and play for about 3 hours at a time. If you don't know anything about it, D&D is a fantasy
			role-playing tabletop game. I play as a Goliath Barbarian named Hale Blackfist, who is a great fighter. This is probably my favorite thing to do 
			with my friends lately. I collect D&D dice and I own a few D&D books.</li><a href="http://dnd.wizards.com/">More info</a>
			<li>Another thing I enjoying doing is play Super Smash Brothers Ultimate on the Nintendo Switch. The Super Smash Bros series has been a favorite of 
			mine for a long time. It is a semi-competitive fighting game that is basically a big crossover of the most popular Nintendo games. I would consider myself the be better than average 
			at the game. I've gone to one tournament for it, but I didn't compete. I did, however, play against one professional player, and I was able to hold my own against him, so I am pretty confident with my abilities. Most of my friends play the game as well, but I don't think any of them are better than me.</li><a href="https://www.smashbros.com/en_US/">More info</a>

		<p style="color: #009B95;">My main goal as of right now is is to complete college and to obtain my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science. Once I'm out of college is when my life really begins I feel like. I plan on moving into an apartment with my girlfriend as soon as I get a good job and start my career. A friend of mine basically guaranteed me a job at the company he works at, making more than enough money to support my girlfriend and I.</p>
		<p style="color: #009B95;">A big goal in my life is to someday own a Tesla. I believe that Tesla vehicles are the start of a big revolution in the modern automotive industry and I really support what they're trying to do. All of Tesla's vehicles are completely emission free, and electric-powered. Most electric cars in the industry right now are extremely inefficient and not very powerful, Tesla is proving to the industry that electric cars don't have to be terrible.</p>
		<p style="color: #009B95;">Probably the strangest dream of mine is to someday own an F1 Savannah cat. This is a big goal for my girlfriend and I. These cats are enormous and beautiful creatures.</p>
